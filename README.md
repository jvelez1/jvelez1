Hey there! 🙋🏻‍♂️

My name is Josué Vélez, but friends use to call me Vélez, It can be easier. I’m from Venezuela 🇻🇪, but I’m living in the beautiful Barcelona city, Spain 🇪🇸.

I’m a pragmatic software engineer with over 6 years of experience as a Backend Developer with strong knowledge in Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, and good knowledge in technologies like Elixir, Phoenix Typescript & Nestjs.

I have experience working in Fast-Growing YC Startups from their initial stage to big investment round achievement, following CI/CD practices, software methodologies, and agile.

I worked for projects in Venezuela, Perú, México, Spain, and remotely. Currently I’m working in J&T, Remote. I’m fast learning, dedicated, with good communication skills.

Currently focusing more in functional programming, and Elixir!

Don’t hesitate to contact me if you need help! 😊
